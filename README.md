# Pinchord

(Abandoned) Full English Orthospelling Theory.

Pinchord used to be called "Onyx" by the way, so if you could just do the fine and replace of "Onyx" to "Pinchord" in your head, that would save me a good amount of work.

Or just yell at me if you see anywhere it says "Onyx" and then I'll probably change it.

This repo contains the Pinchord dictionaries. For the layouts on Plover and Javelin, see https://github.com/Grahp/plover-onyx-layout and https://github.com/Grahp/javelin-onyx-layout
